# This is a project for [TODO](http://www.bittiger.io/microproject/KmcxazLmePpSm6XqY)

### What's the problem to solve

Implement a TODO list web application with the following functionality:

Initial page with empty “TODO list”
* User has the ability to Add/Delete a TODO item
* User has the ability to mark one item as completed
* User has the ability to view TODO list items in different tabs based on the following states:
	* All
	* Active
	* Completed
* A search bar is provided, so that the user is able to search for a particular TODO item

### Prerequisites

I started with the todo list example from AngularJS [home](https://angularjs.org/) page. The goal is to make a barebone tutorial for the bittiger community. All you need is a browser to run. That's it!
